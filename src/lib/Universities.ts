On April 22, 1966, it was granted university status through a Royal Charter. Today, Aston is based on a 60-acre urban campus at Gosta Green in the heart of Birmingham, welcoming more than 18,000 students representing over 120 nationalities. It is widely recognized as one of the most diverse universities in the UK.",
